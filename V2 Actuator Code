//Pseudo code
//configure digital pin to be the MOSFET gate pin
//define gate pin as output
//read the analog input from the comparator and the duty cycle of the input signal received from the sensor system
//write duty the digtal pin
//this will be a feedback loop, the motor speed will give
//feedback and the comparator will help the Arduino make adjustments as needed (we will use the change function)
